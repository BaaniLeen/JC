  <h1>Competitor Intelligence</h1><hr><br>
  <p class="mx-auto" style="width: 1200px;">
    <b>Search clients may retain us exclusively to map markets on their behalf.</b> This often includes full mapping for an agreed list of targeted banks or partnership structures in firms.<br><br>
    This generally involves not only the composition of the team but also detailed biographies of the individuals, products traded or trading floor organization, layout and structure.<br><br>
    This service is <i>generally commissioned</i> when a client company plans a major launch or restructure and wants a compressive ‘plan of attack’ to ensure numbers of staff can be simultaneously attracted on an organised planned and managed basis. We have extensive experience in the complex task at moving entire teams or practice groups.<br><br>
    <i>We have also been commissioned to provide</i> detailed compensation and benefit surveys and bonus expectations and our daily interaction with candidates and clients places us in a unique position to provide authoritative data. Confidentially is always fully respected.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h1> Search process</h1>
  <p class="mx-auto" style="width: 1200px;">
    Above all else, We provide our clients with extraordinary service and the utmost in professionalism. Confidentiality - for both our clients and the candidates we contact on their behalf - is of great importance in our process. Our goal is to simplify and streamline the search process, allowing clients to focus on their core businesses. We take responsibility for the search, handle the details, keep clients informed, and stay focused on searches to completion.<br><br>
    With our focus on locating appropriate candidates for positions - not positions for candidates - we provide superior results for both parties, and deliver total satisfaction. We are proud that our repeat business rate is over 90%. You can always turn to Jolly Consultants to meet the people needs of business' better than anyone else.<br><br>
    <font color="blue">Our disciplined approach to recruitment includes the following:</font><br>
    <b>Definition:</b> We first seek to fully understand the position as well as the company. Our next step is to develop a job description and detailed search criteria which include not only the technical skills but the leadership, interpersonal and softer performance skills required.<br><br>
    <b>Strategy/Research:</b> After agreement on the search criteria, we develop a customized strategy for the search. The search process involves many resources, including our own industry expertise and contacts, affiliations with national search industry groups, professional researchers, our state-of-the-art database of candidates, and a substantial proprietary network developed over many years.<br><br>
    <b>Recruiting/Screening:</b> We evaluate prospective candidates against the established criteria, and build the interest of those qualified. Our goal in all searches is to present several highly qualified candidates to our clients. We present people who are capable of performing the work, who are sincerely interested in the position, whose goals fall within the salary range, and who fit the client's corporate culture.<br><br>
    <b>Selection:</b> Only after the above qualifications are met do we present a resume and our written summary of each candidate's qualifications. And we continue to work with our clients during the entire selection process as needed, including offering our assistance with interviews and the final selection.<br><br>
    <b>Reference Checks:</b> We conduct thorough reference checks and verify education degrees.<br><br>
    <b>Closure:</b> When the right candidate is identified, we act as a liaison between the client and the candidate. We are available to assist in whatever capacity may be required, including assisting with offers, negotiations, and relocation. We strive to pave the way for a comfortable and compatible relationship in which both client and candidate are extremely pleased.<br><br>
    <font color="blue"><b>This is how we define a successful search!</b></font>
  </p><hr>
  <h1> Our Methodology</h1><br>
  <p class="mx-auto" style="width: 1200px;">
    A search Assignment follows a clear tried and tested course.<br>
    <ul>
        <b>Understand the client:</b>
        We have detailed discussions with the Client, so that our consultant not only knows the technical requirements of a role but also understand the client organisation, its culture, challenges and opportunities to ensure there is a lasting fit and the attractions of the role are fully understood.<br><br>
        <b>Position Profile:</b>
        We write a full position profile including candidate profile, and likely career background and skill sets and get consent from the client before commencing the search.<br><br>
        <b>Parameters Agreed:</b>
        During the discussion with the client we review and agree any target companies or markets of particular interest and address compensation and culture issues.<br><br>
        <b>Evaluation:</b>
        Candidates are approached by our consultants in absolute confidence and, where appropriate, they are met to discuss the opportunity, the scope for advancement and their ‘fit’ for the role. This may necessitate several discussions with the candidates.<br><br>
        <b>A Short List:</b>
        We present our client a list of the most suitable individuals, together with a background report on the various candidates on the Target List and the short listed candidate report contains detailed biographies and our consultant’s suggestions. Our opinions are expressed forthrightly and without bias or conflict.<br><br>
        <b>Client Interviews:</b>
        Our consultant works with the client to arrange and plan the interview process. We work closely with both the client and the candidates to ensure each party gets feedback and reflections from the other and the post-interview debriefs are an essential and delicate part of the process.<br>
        <b>Engagement:</b>
        We assist the client in the parameters of an offer letter and the offer stage is the most sensitive in the process. Our candidates are invariably highly valued by their current employer and the majority of offers result in counter bids and Jolly Consultants have many years experience in managing candidate psychology by addressing the likelihood in advance with the candidate and canvassing their reaction to a counter offer or a variety of competing offers.<br>
      Due to our in depth market knowledge and close relationships with our clients, our Consultants often arrange preliminary peer-to-peer meetings between clients and candidates where our consultants have identified reciprocal benefits. In this sense they can often find a Candidate the job they want in the absence of a specific mandate.<br>
      <hr>
      <h1>Values and Philosophy</h1>
      <p>
        JOLLY CONSULTANTS has a clear commitment to treating clients, candidates and colleagues in a professional, honest and ethical manner at all times.<br>
        Our internal code in respect to candidate and client confidentiality is absolute.<br><br>
        Because most of the time, we are  working closely with our client companies, getting their consent and keep them appraised, it is rare for conflicts of interest to arise. Where they do, we address them forthrightly and transparently.<br><br>
        In making candidate information available to our clients we do so in detail and without bias.<br><br>
        It’s our focus on and reputation for confidentiality, good faith, trust and absolute discretion, which has enabled us to have direct access to the most successful and effective candidates in the region.<br><br>
        Trust. Our business has been built on the long-term relationships we have nurtured with both our corporate clients and candidates. We believe such relationships must be based on integrity, trust, and mutual respect.<br><br>
        Teamwork. We become a partner with our clients, working with you as a member of your management team to help you achieve your objectives in meeting clearly defined staffing needs.<br><br>
        Excellence. We are committed to excellence and pride ourselves in being thorough in our search and in our follow-through.<br><br>
        Communication. Our experience has proven that the sharing of information...open communication between the direct hiring official, the coordinating human resources representative, the candidate, and Marketing Consultants Inc....is essential to mutual success.<br><br>
        Selectivity. In proposing candidates to clients, we believe in quality over quantity. We present only candidates that we truly believe can do the job. We have a personal interest in our candidates' career success as well as a solid commitment to meeting our clients' needs.<br><br>
        Insight. We are experienced at understanding our clients business, corporate environment, and management style. We believe that chemistry and personality fit are as critical to a successful match as the candidate's other credentials.<br><br>
        Discipline. We are extremely result-oriented. We approach our assignments in a disciplined manner that closely parallels the way our client companies create solutions to marketing problems.<br><br>
